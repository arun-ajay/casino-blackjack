## NOTE: This front end works with smart contract PRIOR to rcom/rD/rP.

As soon as smart contract functions are fully functional, I'll setup the front end for the new functions with their new parameters and whatnot

The front end includes:

- smart contract (check /src) (copy/paste this into remix if you want to deploy new one)
- an abi of an already deployed smart contract (older smart contract) (check src/Abis)
- smartContractAddress (check src/Config)
